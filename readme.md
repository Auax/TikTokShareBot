This version is based of [TikTokMassBotting](https://github.com/Wizz1337/TikTokMassBotting), although this version runs faster because of the **asynchronus** implementation.

It usually does around `980 requests/s`

## Features

```js
* Share botting (up to 980 requests/s)
* Easy to use (paste video and set the amount)
* Tested in Windows (must test in Linux)
```

## Installation
* Download the files and access the folder `cd TikTokShareBot`
* Download _**Python 3**_ and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the repository folder.

Or install the packages manually:
```

  * pip install pystyle~=1.5
```

## Usage:

```
